The Bellman-Ford algorithm isn't designed to use a priority queue because of its fundamental approach to solving the single-source shortest path problem.


Dijkstra's algorithm is more efficient for graphs with non-negative weights. It uses a priority queue (typically a min-heap) to always select the vertex with the smallest known distance from the source, ensuring that each vertex is processed in order of shortest path discovered.

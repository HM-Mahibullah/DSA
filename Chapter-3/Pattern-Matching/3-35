First strcpy Call (strcpy(s, "NEW YORK");):

strcpy(s, "NEW YORK"); copies the string "NEW YORK" into the character array s.
Since s has a fixed length of 12 characters, "NEW YORK" (which is 8 characters long including the null terminator \0) fits within the array bounds.

Second strcpy Call (strcpy(s, "SOUTH CAROLINA");):

strcpy(s, "SOUTH CAROLINA"); replaces the contents of s with "SOUTH CAROLINA".
"SOUTH CAROLINA" (which is 15 characters long including the null terminator) exceeds the fixed length of s.
This can lead to undefined behavior in C/C++, commonly known as a buffer overflow, where memory beyond the allocated size 
(s in this case) may be overwritten. In practice, the behavior can vary from crashing the program to unpredictable results.


Third strcpy Call:

strcpy(s, "PENNSYLVANIA"); replaces the content of s with "PENNSYLVANIA".
s now contains "PENNSYLVANIA" followed by a null character ('\0').
cout << s << endl; prints the updated contents of s, which outputs "PENNSYLVANIA".
